# CryptoCorrelation

Small project for studying the effects of correlation between cryptocurrencies caused by DEX pairs, as explained in my blog post:

* https://thomasvilhena.com/2022/04/an-inherent-source-of-correlation-in-crypto

If you run the console app the output will be:

```
BTC/ETH price = 14,06250140625014
BTC/USD price = 45000,00450000045
ETH/USD price = 3200

BTC/ETH price = 14,06250140625014
BTC/USD price = 45602,00456020046
ETH/USD price = 3200

BTC/ETH price = 14,124793776163136
BTC/USD price = 45400,002312175784
ETH/USD price = 3214,2064383686643
```
